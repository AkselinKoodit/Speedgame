# Speedgame (has sounds)

This is my take on the classic speedgame to test your reaction speed. Click the active circle (the one with the face) and try to keep up as the speed accelerates. If you click wrong circle/too slow or miss a couple active circles (don't click at all), game ends. Scoring:
 - 0-4: "Pathetic"
 - 5-9 "You can do better"
 - 10-14 "Not bad at all!"
 - 15-19 "Awesome!
 - \>19 "YOU MUST BE THE CHOSEN ONE!"
 
 ## Tech
 
 App is built with React.js. I practiced using sound so beware. Background music kicks in when you click start game. There's other sounds as well.
